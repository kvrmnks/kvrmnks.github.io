# Bio
I am a first year PhD student in the [theory group](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/) of NJU. I am adviced by Prof. [Jingcheng Liu](https://liuexp.github.io/) and Prof. [Yitong Yin](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/yinyt/). I got bachelor's degree from SDU in 2023 where I am adviced by Prof. [Haitao Jiang](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/info/1070/2808.htm). I'm interested in TCS. I focus on approximate sampling and counting now.
